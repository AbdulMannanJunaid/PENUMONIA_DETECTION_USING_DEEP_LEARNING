# PNEUMONIA_DETECTION_USING_DEEP_LEARNING
A common and possibly fatal respiratory infection, pneumonia affects millions of individuals worldwide.The traditional diagnostic process for pneumonia primarily relies on chest X-rays, which can be resource-intensive and often require advanced medical facilities. While these methods are effective, they may not be readily available in resource-constrained or remote settings.
Here comes the Penumonia Detection Using DeepvLearning
Input is given as audio mp3 format to which is converted to wav format. Then model detectes the audio and give results if it is positive for Penumonia or Not.
Convocational Neural Networks :
A convolutional neural network (CNN), is a network architecture for deep learning which learns directly from data. CNNs are particularly useful for finding patterns, commonly used for image and audio processing tasks, including audio classification. While cough sounds are essentially one-dimensional audio signals, CNNs can be adapted to handle such data. A convolutional neural network can have tens or hundreds of layers that each learn to detect different features of an image or audio
The method to approach is Data collection, Data preprocessing, Model training, Testing, Model evaluation, performance.
